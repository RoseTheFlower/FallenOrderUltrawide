The tool removes black bars from cutscenes and allows to manually control the game field of view in real time.

1. Unpack the archive
2. Launch the game first, followed by the tool.

All trainers based on CE components may trigger some anti-virus software.

Tested the latest Origin version at 2560x1080 and 5760x1080.
